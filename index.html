                            Currently working at a company specializing in VR/AR development for automotive projects.
                            Focused on creating detailed VR/AR experiences for car refinement and refitment procedures.
                            Developed interactive simulations that guide users through each step of refining and
                            upgrading vehicle components.
                            Created immersive info panels that provide in-depth information about every car part,
                            enhancing user understanding and engagement.
                            Worked on image tracking projects using PlayCanvas to enhance AR capabilities.
                            Developed web-based automobile integration systems to provide seamless user experiences
                            across platforms.
                            Utilized VR/AR technology to offer a hands-on learning experience for mechanics, engineers,
                            and car enthusiasts, improving their skills and knowledge.

                            I worked as a freelance VR developer for a studio that specialized in creating immersive
                            educational experiences. Our main focus was on transforming traditional classroom topics
                            into interactive virtual reality (VR) lessons for students from grades 8 to 10.
                            We selected various science experiments from biology, chemistry, and physics and
                            recreated
                            them in VR.For example, one of the projects I worked on involved simulating a chemical
                            reaction in a VR environment.
                            I designed a virtual lab where users could interact with different test tubes and
                            chemicals.
                            When a user mixed two chemicals, the VR environment would simulate the chemical
                            reaction. An
                            audio guide would play simultaneously, explaining the experiment's process and outcome.
                            Additionally, there was an electronic-level visual representation that showed how
                            electrons
                            were reacting during the chemical process, providing a deeper understanding of the
                            molecular
                            changes taking place.This approach allowed students to engage with educational content
                            in a
                            more hands-on and visually dynamic way, making learning more interactive and effective.

                        During my time at GameEon, I had the opportunity to work on Construct 2 and 3 projects
                        designed
                        for Reliance Jio Feature phones.
                        In this role, I acquired proficiency in Construct 2/3 and successfully implemented various
                        monitoring SDKs to track game performance.
                        One notable addition to the projects was the integration of an ads screen, strategically
                        placed
                        to display advertisements after a player
                        lost a game or to provide rewards. This experience not only deepened my understanding of
                        game
                        development with Construct 2/3 but also allowed
                        me to contribute to monetization strategies by incorporating ad displays within the gaming
                        experience.

                        During my time at GameEon, I had the opportunity to work on Construct 2 and 3 projects
                        designed
                        for Reliance Jio Feature phones.
                        In this role, I acquired proficiency in Construct 2/3 and successfully implemented various
                        monitoring SDKs to track game performance.
                        One notable addition to the projects was the integration of an ads screen, strategically
                        placed
                        to display advertisements after a player
                        lost a game or to provide rewards. This experience not only deepened my understanding of
                        game
                        development with Construct 2/3 but also allowed
                        me to contribute to monetization strategies by incorporating ad displays within the gaming
                        experience.

                        As a freelance developer for the Ace+ project, I focused on creating an educational 2D game,
                        acquiring valuable skills in the process. I implemented a state machine to enhance game
                        logic
                        and transitions,
                        ensuring a smooth user experience. Additionally, I delved into 2D game development,
                        optimizing
                        performance and crafting engaging gameplay.
                        A notable aspect of my role involved saving and fetching audio files locally for playback in
                        the
                        Unity application, adding a dynamic layer to
                        the overall gaming experience. This project not only expanded my skill set but also
                        contributed
                        to the success of a meaningful educational initiative.
