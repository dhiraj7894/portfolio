                        As a Unity programmer specializing in hyper-casual, VR, HTML5, and casual games,
                        I am passionate about creating engaging and immersive gaming experiences for players.
                        With expertise in Unity game engine and a deep understanding of game mechanics,
                        I am able to bring game ideas to life that captivate audiences across a range of
                        platforms and devices. Whether I'm creating simple, addictive gameplay for hyper-casual
                        games or designing immersive worlds for VR, I am dedicated to delivering games that are
                        polished,
                        optimized, and fun to play. With a collaborative spirit and a commitment to excellence,

                        I had the privilege of working with IXR Labs as a client of GameEon company,
                        where I played a pivotal role in the IXR Labs project. My responsibilities centered around
                        integrating new modules into the project,
                        leveraging my skills to enhance functionality and contribute to its overall success.
                        IXR Labs, a valued client of GameEon, is widely recognized for its innovative solutions in
                        Virtual Reality (VR),
                        and my work aligns with their commitment to pushing technological boundaries. Collaborating with
                        a talented team,
                        I contributed to the expansion and improvement of the project, further establishing IXR Labs as
                        a leader in the field.
                        This experience not only deepened my expertise in Unity Programming and Modual integrating but
                        also allowed me to work with a
                        dynamic and forward-thinking client at the forefront of innovation.

                        As a freelance developer for the Ace+ project, I focused on creating an educational 2D game,
                        acquiring valuable skills in the process. I implemented a state machine to enhance game logic
                        and transitions,
                        ensuring a smooth user experience. Additionally, I delved into 2D game development, optimizing
                        performance and crafting engaging gameplay.
                        A notable aspect of my role involved saving and fetching audio files locally for playback in the
                        Unity application, adding a dynamic layer to
                        the overall gaming experience. This project not only expanded my skill set but also contributed

                        for Reliance Jio Feature phones.
                        In this role, I acquired proficiency in Construct 2/3 and successfully implemented various
                        monitoring SDKs to track game performance.
                        One notable addition to the projects was the integration of an ads screen, strategically placed
                        to display advertisements after a player
                        lost a game or to provide rewards. This experience not only deepened my understanding of game
                        development with Construct 2/3 but also allowed
                        me to contribute to monetization strategies by incorporating ad displays within the gaming
                        experience.

                                <p>A rock wheel trench cutter is an excavator used to dig trenches in hard and rocky
                                    terrain.
                                    The machine is equipped with a rotating cutting wheel that is mounted on an
                                    articulated arm that is capable of cutting trenches in a wide variety of different
                                    shapes and sizes.

                        During my tenure at Moongslabs, I contributed to the development of the EPIC CRICKET project,
                        currently live on the Play Store.
                        My responsibilities primarily revolved around refining game mechanics, addressing various bugs
                        that surfaced during development,
                        and optimizing the overall gameplay for a more efficient and enjoyable user experience. My role
                        in enhancing the performance and playability of
                        EPIC CRICKET reflects my dedication to delivering a high-quality gaming product to users.
